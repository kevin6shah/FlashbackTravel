# Flashback Travels

Simple website I made to showcase my travel experiences in Banff and Jasper.

## Languages/Technologies Used

- HTML: Used HTML to create the website structure.
- CSS: Used to add visual elements and a theme to the website.
- JSP: Used to connect the website to the backend database.
- mySQL: Relational database used to store user credentials and comments.
- Ubuntu Server: Home server that hosts the website and the database.

## Motivation

During May 2019, I took a trip to Alberta, CA where I explored the two famous towns Banff and Jasper. After the amazing experiences I had in these towns, I decided to publish my observations to the internet as well as learn the technical skills necessary to build and host a website. I knew that there were third party tools like Wordpress and AWS that can be help me do this much faster but I wanted to learn and create everything from scratch. So I built my website using only HTML, CSS, and JSP. For hosting, I was able to turn my old laptop into an Ubuntu Server that can be used to host my website, mySQL database, and even be used as a Media Server.
