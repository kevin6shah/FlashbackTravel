    <p id="profile-desc">Hello, my name is Kevin Shah and I am currently a student
    at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. During the summer of 2019, I visited Banff &
    Jasper National Parks in Alberta, Canada on the way from Vancouver to Calgary. Overall,
    my trip was a great success and I never felt as close to nature as I did there. So I decided
    to share my story with a bigger audience and highlight some of the best times I had there. As a
    Computer Science student, I chose to do so by learning some basic web-development and design and
    building my very first website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I hope the experiences
    and resources I share with you not only give you an insight on my trip to these beautiful
    parks, but also assist you in case you plan for such a trip yourself.</p>
