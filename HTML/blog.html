        Driving through the Icefields Parkway from Banff to Jasper made me realize just how beautiful nature can be. Rated as one of the
        most scenic drives on earth, the <a target="_blank" href="http://travelwithbender.com/travel-blog/western-canada/icefields-parkway" title="Icefields Parkway: The Most Scenic Drive On Earth">Icefields Parkway</a>
        is a long 144 mile highway that links Jasper and Lake Louise. A map of this can be found under the resources tab.

        We started our trip on the Icefields Parkway with Lake Louise. The lake had an aquamarine tint to it. Surrounded by three enormous mountains,
        the lake sat in the center of it all. The best way I would describe it would be "Quiet and Beautiful". Directly adjacent to the lake was
        the 5-star Fairmont Hotel which looked less like a hotel from the inside and more like a tourist attraction. The hotel's first floor was
        full of stores ranging from jewelry and clothing to souvenirs. Although the lake looked beautiful, it was surrounded by tourists which I felt like
        took away from the "isolated" experience.

        Unlike Lake Louise, Moraine Lake was very blue in color and had a lot less tourists. I found that the coloring was a result of the bed-rocks under glaciers grinding with each other
        to create the blueish water that we see. I immediately fell in love with Moraine Lake and all its beauty and isolation. Naturally, as any curious mind would have it, I tried to
        touch the water and it was <em>freezing</em>. Holding even just a little bit of water in my hand felt like holding ice. Nonetheless, the canoeing experience I had there
        was really special to me. Being in the middle of one of the most famous lakes in the world felt exhiliarating. Just next to the lake was a mountain of rocks
        that people were climbing. Although it looked quite dangerous, the view was probably worth the risk. So I went for it, and I wasn't wrong.

        Other than those two famous lakes, the Icefields Parkway also consisted of many glaciers. One of which was the Colombian Icefield. It was a 250 feet deep glacier
        and we stood on it and even took plenty of pictures. The interesting thing was the bus that took us to the glacier. It is known with current inflation that the
        bus that took us to the glacier values at $1.3 million today and the company that hosts this adventure has over 20 of those limited buses while there are only 27 of them
        in the world.
      </p>

        Overall, my experience was that of appreciation. I now value all the things that nature provides us with as well as noticing little things about its history and beauty as a whole.
